I washed them and they did appear to shrink a little, but after wearing them for one outing, they stretched out again. I think these do the trick if you're wearing them for a few minutes at the time, and if you wash them...after every use?

These masks fit perfectly. They are soft, fairly thick, and easy to breathe through. Also, they are not hot. They don't have a bendable nose band, but they are sewn with darts so they are contoured to fit well. I am very happy with these masks. The price is good for the quality of the mask.

They were much easier to breathe in than the homemade masks that I had made at the start of the pandemic and I appreciated that they were a thick jersey material while still being comfortable. When they arrived, the four colors were a variety of sizes to begin with which was odd. The white one was the loosest and was great for walking the dog. However, after being washed frequently (which is just plain necessary) they could now fit a child. In fact, I donated them to my friend with a pre-teen who fell into the gap of adult masks being too big and child masks being too small and they worked great for her. They just don't maintain their shape at all and I wonder how much they'll continue to shrink.
